BBasic Installation
=1;2c=================

First, you'll need a few prerequisites.
 - the latest libopkele from http://kin.klever.net/libopkele/
	It's a C++ implementation of important OpenID functions.

 - libsqlite from http://www.sqlite.org
	SQLite C libs

Next, run:
$> ./configure
or 
$> ./configure --help
to see additional options that can be specified.

Next, run:
$> make
$> su root
$> make install

Make sure that the file /tmp/mod_auth_openid.db is owned by the user running Apache.
You can do this by (assuming www-data is the user running apache):
$> su root
$> touch /tmp/mod_auth_openid.db
$> chown www-data /tmp/mod_auth_openid.db

Or you can specify an alternate location that the user running apache has write 
privieges on (see the docs for the AuthOpenIDDBLocation directive on the homepage).


See README for usage.
